# Aviya Ben David - SOAP  #
This is the challenge of SOAP.

## What is the challenge? ##
find the flag - 
The web project was rushed and no security assessment was done.  I need to check if I can read the /etc/passwd file?

## How to solve it? ##
+ Open this [link](https://play.picoctf.org/practice?search=soap)
+ Click on inspect
+ Get into *network*
+ Click on Detail button  
+ Get into the data
+ In the *Headers* button we can see a request of POST to [page](http://saturn.picoctf.net:53062/data) with the information in *payload* for example in detail 2 : we get the id: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><data><ID>2</ID></data>.
+ We will go to detail 1 and we will see what is written in *Payload* , we can see that ID is: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><data><ID>1</ID></data>
+ We will check what will happen if we do POST request with the same link above but with a ID that is not 1,2,3 ' for example we will choose ID=4.
+ I used in ***Insomnia*** to check what happens: 
  1.  Open *Insomnia*
  2.  We choose POST request and XML type of text.
  3.  Send it with *send button*
  4.  We will receive the results and we can see it on images directory.
  5. In the last line of the result, we can see the flag that we looking for.
+ We can see that we can ask from the page his own data and use it. we can extract classified data.
+ **The result flag is: picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_0e13660d}**
